**Auction House**

Auction House is a web application built with Next.js that provides a simple and efficient platform for users to auction off their items to other users. The application enables seamless bidding, listing, and purchasing of items in a user-friendly environment.

Features

User Authentication – Secure login and registration for users.

Item Listing – Users can list items for auction with images, descriptions, and starting bids.

Bidding System – Other users can place bids on listed items until the auction ends.

Auction Timer – Auctions have a set duration after which the highest bidder wins.

User Dashboard – Manage listings, bids, and won items from a personalized dashboard.




**How to Run ?**
Running the site locally isnt possible as it consists of usage of Azure DB so the necessary env will be needed, I request you to kindly wait till the site is hosted (or please contact me for a demo of the same).


(ps: this is my web programming lab project)
